      <h1>Who are the QIKT Community</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The Quarantine Island Kamau Taurua Community are the caring, passionate kaitiaki (guardians) of this very special island. <br><br>

Our charity employs the resident Keeper, who lives on the Island, looking after visitors and managing everything for us. Other QIKT Community members live on the mainland, and share similar values about social justice, caring for people and the natural environment, and protecting our heritage.<br><br>

We find working together to care for and enhance the island, and just spending time there, is deeply satisfying and rejuvenating. Encouraging and modelling a sustainable, caring and cooperative society is important to us, and we particularly try to involve young people.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">The Island ‘Community’  all live in different parts of Dunedin, or even further away (Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, Otatara…), with busy lives, juggling other commitments, wearing multiple ‘hats’. Some make it to the Island most months for our Island open day, others once or twice a year and some not at all these days.

It’s not easy to define exactly who the ‘Quarantine Island Community’ is. However, we know many people have experienced something special about the Island and their time there. We are delighted people continue to be drawn to the Island, to help with projects, to talk, to dream, to have fun, and to consider serious issues, such as climate change. For those who can’t make it to the Island physically, but continue to have a special place in their heart for the Island and others in the Community take an interest in what is going on from afar via our email newsletter and facebook page.

Please feel free to visit the Island on our open days to get to know us and the Island. If you have a passion for social justice, ecology and the environment, the building of sustainable communities, finding sanctuary in nature, or finding peace within, you will find a place for you here.</p>

We build on the work and vision of many people who have gone before us, including our founding body, the St Martin Island Community. We officially changed our name in 2015. The long-standing name of the community ‘St Martin’ lives on in the renamed ‘St Martin Lodge’.
